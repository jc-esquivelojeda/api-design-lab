## Reporte
### Retos afrontados:
- Definicion de los endpoints sin tener claro el dise√±o o los mockups basicos para el flujo de trabajo
- Seguimiento al flujo de operacion para el ecommerce sin una guia definida
- Establecer los posibles escenarios de error que pudiera presentarse al consumir los endpoints
  
### Como se aplico el principio de api primero para dise√±ar un api robusta
- se aplicaron nombres descriptivos para los endpoints tomando en cuenta la
- se aplico versionamiento del API nombrando la version 1.0.0, adicionalmente se diferencio entre los endpoint para produccion de desarrollo
- Se manejo un nombrado consistente para los endpoints en base al endpoint base
- Se utilizaron los metodos http para indicar la posible accion a realizar segun el endpoint, Ej: DELETE para borrar/deactivar, PUT para actualizar, etc...

### Conocimientos adquiridos del laboratorio

- Al aplicar un estandar comun para el principio de api first permite tener claridad sobre que esperar en la documentaci√≥n de un api
- Tambien mejora la colaboraci√≥n ya que al seguir un estandar al cual fijarse asegura que se cumplan los criterios establecidos
- El uso de este principio permite mejorar  la comunicacion entre el equipo de back y front para establecer los requisitos del API necesarios para ambos lados
- El hecho de pensar por adelantado en los errores que se podrian presentar permite ir dise√±ando un API mas flexible
